Put all examples in here.  Examples are **required** to be complete code!
Users *must* be able to copy the example to their own code and have it
compile and run with minimal effort on their part, and the test
facilities *must* be able to run the examples to verify that they are still
working.  Code sketches belong in the doc comments, not here.
